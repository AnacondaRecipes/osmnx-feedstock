  summary: Python for street networks. Retrieve, model, analyze, and visualize street networks and other spatial data from OpenStreetMap.
  description: OSMnx is a Python package that lets you download spatial geometries and model, project, visualize, and analyze real-world street networks from OpenStreetMap's APIs. Users can download and model walkable, drivable, or bikeable urban networks with a single line of Python code, and then easily analyze and visualize
    them. You can just as easily download and work with amenities/points of interest, building footprints, elevation data, street bearings/orientations, speed/travel time, and network routing.
